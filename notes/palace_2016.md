# Palace et al. 2016 - Estimating tropical forest structure using a terrestrial LiDAR

Used LiDAR data to create:

* Relative vegetation profiles
* Number of layers (number of local maximums)
* Plant Area Index

FARO Focus 3D scanner

The describe how they calculated the relative height profiles.

Extracted metrics from the height profiles:

* peak maxima (height above ground of largest maxima)
* profile median height
* ratio of median height to maximum height of each profile
* elevation difference between highest and lowest maxima
* entropy (forest height diversity in 1 m bins) and lidar coherence of fourier transforms using fast fourier transforms at varying frequencies shown to be correlated with biomass when using airborne lidar data.
