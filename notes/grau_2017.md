# Grau et al. 2017 - Estimation of 3D vegetation density with Terrestrial Laser Scanning data using voxels. A sensitivity analysis of influencing parameters

Error increases with a larger scan angle resolution, single echo TLS systems, and vegetation density.

Spherical voxels do not give significantly better results than cubic voxels.

Large voxels tend to have better statistical consistency so that the beer-lambert law hypothesis on random and uniform distribution of material is respected, as long as clumping effects are negligible.
