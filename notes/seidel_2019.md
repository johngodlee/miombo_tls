# Seidel et al. 2019 - Identifying architectural characteristics that determine tree structural complexity

Forest structural complexity is positively related to ecosystem services and functions

Use "fractal analysis" to describe structural complexity

> Consequently, it is not surprising that forest structure was shown to be related to important ecosystem services and functions provided by forests, such as scenic beauty (Ribe 2009), biodiversity (Lindenmayer et al. 2000), ecosystem resilience and adaptability (Neill and Puettmann 2013), productivity (DaÌ†nescu et al. 2016; Juchheim et al. 2017a), microclimatic stability (Ehbrecht et al. 2017) as well as habi- tat provision (Eichhorn et al. 2017).
