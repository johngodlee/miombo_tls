# Henning et al. 2006 - Ground-based laser imaging for assessing three-dimensional forest canopy structure

Broad-leaved woodland in North Carolina

0.5 m voxel size for gap fraction.

Time-of-flight Riegl scanner

Manually estimated tree heights from the point cloud

Estimated DBH from point cloud

Made nice maps of tree location points lined up with LAI to show clustering. Points were sized by DBH

Made canopy surface models from maximum height information

The validation of TLS results remains labour intensive
