# Calders et al. 2020 - Terrestrial laser scanning in forest ecology: Expanding the horizon

Time Of Flight (TOF) Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) systems are widely recognised as the best option for measuring forest structure and tree architecture with the highest spatial detail (Newnham et al. 2015).

Methods for analysing TLS data from forests can be classified broadly as:

* Gap probability
* Geometrical modelling

LAI quantifies area of leaf material per unit area

Good description of the equations used to estimate LAI in forests

Voxel size is not trivial to estimate, because occlusion and beam divergence will make it so that voxels further away have fewer points.

Both pulse-based and voxel-based approaches to estimating LAI make assumptions about foliage distribution which aren't always valid in reality.

Even without the more complex corrections for leaf angle distribution, TLS is still more accurate than hemi photos for estimating LAI.

Software for tree isolation for geometric modelling include _3D FOREST_ and _Treeseg_.

_computree_ integrates stuff like this in a GUI.
