# Beland et al. 2014 - On seeing the wood from the leaves and the role of voxel size in determining leaf area distribution of forests with terrestrial LiDAR

Voxels must be small enough to exclude large gaps between crowns and branches. 

Voxels must be large enough for the conditions postulated by the poisson law to be valid, e.g. a turbid medium with randomly positioned leaves

Both a fcuntion of leaf size, branching structure and the predominance of occlusion effects.
