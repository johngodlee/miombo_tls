# Hypotheses

1. Vertical canopy profiles will become more complex as tree species richness increases.
2. For a given stocking density, plots with greater species richness will have a greater foliage area - LAI and canopy closure
3. Species richness will correlate negatively with understorey biomass due to an increase in canopy packing, therefore decreasing light penetration.
4. Canopy surface roughness will increase with tree species richness.
