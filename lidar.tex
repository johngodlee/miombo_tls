\section*{Abstract}

\section{Introduction}

Assessments of woodland canopy structure are most often conducted using indirect
techniques limited to a two-dimensional perspective. Terrestrial Laser Scanning
(TLS) technology offers a means of assessing canopy structure in three
dimensions. This text should hard wrap at 80 columns, wll does it?

 canopy space filling increases with tree species richness

The characterization of forest structure is a long-standing (Watt, 1947; Whittaker & Woodwell, 1969) research area fundamental to interpreting, modelling, and improving the understanding of eco- system functions. 

\section{Materials and methods}

\subsection{Study site}

\subsection{Field measurements}

\subsection{Terrestrial laser scanning}

We used a Leica HDS6100 Terrestrial Laser Scanner, with an angular resolution of
x. This produces a point density of approximately x at x m. Wave length of x nm.

Phase shift

Point clouds within each subplot were registered and unified.

We validated our measurements with traditional digital hemispherical photography
(DHP), with one image taken at the centre point of each subplot.

Acquired our images at the maximum foliage volume in the wet season.

\subsection{Data analysis}

Registration of multiple scans from different locations allows us to minimise
the occlusion effect and improve canopy penetration.

\subsubsection{Scan processing}

Open source methods

Filtering

Voxelisation: Points don't have an area or defined volume and so are unsuitable
for estimating hemispherical points \citep{Seidel2012}.

Objects located closer to the instrument will be represented by a higher density
of points, resulting in an imbalanced representation of the measured 3D space.

Resultant points clouds had ~points, ~points after filtering, ~voxels after
voxelisation.

Classified ground points using the Progressive Morphological Filter (PMF) from
\citep{Zhang2003}. Reclassified height based on this revised ground layer by
measuring the vertical distance between the nearest ground point and each point.

We used ray-tracing (POV-ray) to calculate gap fraction from TLS scans at the
centre of each subplot. Voxels were converted to cubes filling the voxel volume,
with a ``camera'' placed at the subplot centre at 1.8 m height, at a height of
1.8 m. Used a fisheye lens with a view angle of 180 degrees, with matt black
Cubes against a white background and no light source. The images produced by
POV-ray were analysed using Hemiphot in an identical manner to the hemispherical
photographs.
